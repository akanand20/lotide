// For arrays with one or two elements, there is no middle. Return an empty array.- [1]--[], [1,2]-[]
//For arrays with odd number of elements, an array containing a single middle element should be returned. [1,2,3]- [2], length 
//For arrays with an even number of elements, an array containing the two elements in the middle should be returned [1,2,3,4]- [2,3]
//We can and should use the assertArraysEqual function for testing our new function. That's why we brought it in here to begin with.
